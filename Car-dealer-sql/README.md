# Used Car Agency Database Project

## Introduction

The manager of a used car agency aims to streamline operations by transitioning from spreadsheet-based data management to an efficient online system. This database project is designed to facilitate car search functionalities and manage comprehensive car information within the agency.

## Data Description

The dataset `car.csv` under `docs` contains detailed information about used cars, including sales records and attributes relevant to the agency's operations.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a relational database capable of efficiently answering specific queries related to car sales and inventory management:

### SQL Queries

1. **Which car models are sold more?**
2. **Which dealer sells more cars, and what are their total sales?**
3. **What is the average price for each car model?**
4. **What is the newest and oldest car in inventory?**
5. **Which car offers the best value considering price and low mileage?**
6. **What is the total revenue generated from sales?**
