**SQL Queries**:

     2. Which dealer sells more cars, and what are their total sales?
     3. What is the average price for each car model?
     4. What is the newest car and the oldest car?
     5. Which is the best car related to price and low mileage?
     6. What is the total revenue from individual sales?
